						El Salvador and throughout my life I have experimented with every situation and thing that comes my way, I love analysis and I tend to put it into practice for everything in my life. Nowhere you can let even the smallest things escape. Having detailed knowledge and situations is something that makes me feel safe.

						Programming makes me feel the same way, because you need to analyze every thing, code and tool in the best possible way and apply it to an infinite number of fields that I didn't even know existed. The ability to learn daily, put it into practice, add different methods, work tools makes it even more exceptional. This is why I love programming.
